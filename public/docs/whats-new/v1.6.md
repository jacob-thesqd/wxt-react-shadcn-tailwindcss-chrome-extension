## New Features
- On Designer Scheduling page you can now toggle by Design and Video Squad and Other departments making it easier to see who you are viewing
- Cleaned up the navigation menu in the bottom left corner to increase visibility and make it more obvious to users how to navigate pages

## Bugs Fixed
- Fixed permissions on the Designer Scheduling page for who is allowed to edit schedules, who is view only and who does not see the page at all
- Fixed bug where Task Actions buttons on Creative Tools page were all side by side when they were supposed to be stacked causing the "Block from Auto-Assignment" button to be outside the parent container
- Fixed a bug where users could not view internal tasks
- Cleaned up all endpoints used to go through SISX only for consistency and reliability
- Fixed a bug where it was using the wrong endpoint for Refresh Dropbox Folder
